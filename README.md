# C-Sharp_Ascii_Adventure_Game

Features that I added:
1. Jumping 2 steps using IJKL
2. Teleporters:
Walking into a teleport will transport you to the other one in the same direction (i.e. from left to right)
3. Weapon and Mine:
I counted these two objects as one feature since they work together. After the Player picks up the Weapon, they have three Mines in their inventory to place wherever they want on the map to kill the mob. Mines can also be automatically placed on the map when the game starts. Player can also be set up to have unlimited Mines.
4. Treasures:
I upgraded Treasure so that Player can store the number of treasures in their inventory.


Other than those main features, I also added some small, little nuances.
The Game ends when the Player either kills the mob or gathers all the treasures (or gets killed by the mob).


I also fixed some things that I thought were bugs. In the original code, resizing the map was an issue, as well as walking into the map boundaries.
